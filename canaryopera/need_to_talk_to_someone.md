## Suicide is a big issue. 
More people lose their lives to suicide than to road accidents, industrial accidents, and homicides combined. 

If someone you know is struggling emotionally or having a hard time, you can be the difference in getting them the help they need. It’s important to take care of yourself when you are supporting someone through a difficult time, as this may stir up difficult emotions. If it does, please reach out for support yourself.  The cumulative impacts in our daily efforts to reduce stigma, challenge stereotypes, and spread awareness of suicide and its devastating impact can make a difference in people's lives.

## Protect yourself from myths
As well as being incorrect, common myths can stop us recognising when someone is at risk and in need of support. So here are five common misconceptions and the facts you can use to bust these myths (credit to [Sane Australia](https://www.sane.org/information-stories/the-sane-blog/suicide-prevention/busting-the-myths-about-suicide)).

Myth # 1: Talking about suicide might put the idea in their head    
_Fact:_ There’s no harm in asking. If anything, for someone who is thinking about suicide, **talking about it can come as a great a relief, and help them feel less afraid and more in control. Avoiding or tiptoeing around the issue can be isolating and leave people feeling unheard.** The best policy is to try and help someone talk openly about how they are feeling and encourage them to seek help.

Myth #2: People who attempt or end their life by suicide want to die    
_Fact:_ People who attempt suicide are often quite ambivalent about it. They may not really want to die – they may even be afraid of death – but see suicide as the only way to bring an end to their pain. **Providing emotional support, helping them consider positive coping methods, can be helpful to someone who is feeling unsafe.**

Myth #3: Suicidal behaviour is manipulative or ‘attention-seeking’   
_Fact:_ Sometimes people may threaten or attempt suicide as a desperate plea to let others know they are not coping and need help.
**They may not know how to tell others how they are feeling, they may think that no one cares, or that nobody can help them.** However these actions may come across, they should never be treated as trivial or manipulative. All suicidal talk and behaviour is serious and requires a compassionate and immediate response.

Myth #4: Most suicides happen unexpectedly    
_Fact:_ **There are often warning signs prior to suicide.** Some may be obvious, talking about suicide or death. Others less so, such as withdrawing from friends or family, or misusing alcohol and drugs. People who are thinking about dying usually try to seek help. In fact, many people who attempt suicide visit a doctor in the months and weeks prior.

Myth #5: Suicide is a selfish act     
_Fact:_ Many people who attempt suicide feel they are a burden to others, and that their friends and family would be better off without them. While some people recognise that their death will cause their loved one’s pain, **they may also believe they are causing more pain by being alive** and rationalise suicide as a way to protect those they care about.

# Warning Signs
Not everyone will give their friends and loved ones verbal hints about their suicidal thoughts. That's why it's important to recognize warning signs in actions as well as words.

Be wary if you, your loved one, friend, or colleague:
- Begins to search online for ways to kill themselves, such as buying a gun or obtaining medical prescriptions
- Increases their use of alcohol or drugs
- Sleeps too much or too little
- Starts to behave recklessly, such as driving while intoxicated or without a seat belt
- Appears agitated, expresses rage or talks about seeking revenge
- Has extreme mood swings, from euphoria to the depths of depression
- Appears to feel hopeless or talks about feeling trapped or having no reason to live
- Appears to be in unbearable psychological pain or talks about being a burden to friends or family
- Withdraws or isolates from others

## Online community workplace 

We opened a new workspace in the Waterhack Circle on Qiqochat. [In the Big Lake, there is a CALM room](https://waterhack.qiqochat.com/garden/1). This is an experimental workplace environment for doing all the things we know need to be done at work, and for talking about the data and facts about all the things that get in the way of working. While we focus on individual tasks, we are exploring how to accomplish our work with questions such as: What can I do when I can focus on work, while at work? What can I complete when undisrupted by common workplace stressors? What can I do next to maintain a healthy nervous system for generating new ideas?

## Suicide Stigma

If you had a broken leg, you would go to a hospital immediately. There would be no hesitation, and no consideration about what others would "think." 
But what if a stigma was attached to having a broken leg? Then what? What if you could lose your job because of it? What if people would treat you differently because of it? ... Immediate treatment, without stigma, should be our ultimate objective. Because when more people receive treatment for mental illness, there will be fewer suicides.  The causes of suicide are just like any other illness. It can be diagnosed and treated. And the person can get better.

-Asking someone about suicide may plant the idea in their minds
-Suicidal people are fully intent on dying
-Everyone who dies by suicide is depressed
-A sudden improvement in emotional state after a suicide attempt or a depressive period indicates the suicide risk is over.
