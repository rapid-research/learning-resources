# Publication Agreement Template

Team Publication philosophy:  Communicate early and often about emerging researcher products in order to invite and facilitate integrated contributions from team members and project stakeholders (NSF, UW CEE, UW ESS, State of Washington USGS, local & tribal governments).   Generate an inclusive open community approach by building collaborative cultural tools that improve the efficiency and clarity in meeting co-author, contributor, and funder expectations.

## 1.0 Introduction

In an effort to produce FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible) research products, this is intended to communicate with collaborating projects members (authors, contributors and sponsors).  Please use or edit this tool to facilitate an ongoing and improved collaboration process that results in peer reviewed publications and public communications.  Have you added Canary Opera to your Data Management Plan? [Please let us know on an issue](https://github.com/canaryopera/issues). Are you using this template for a publication? Fork the canaryopera repository, add a folder with your publication agreements, and Pull Request so we can add your version and data to the library. 

## 2.0 Definitions, Roles and Responsibilities
The following definitions are developed to describe the use of metadata fields.  

### Authorship 
**Definition**

Author is defined in [Dublin core](http://dublincore.org/documents/1998/09/dces/) as "The person or organization primarily responsible for creating the intellectual content of the resource."

Following Clement (Clement), authors of HydroShare publications are asked to consider that... 

...the title “author ” is like the title “sculptor ” and such titles simply cannot be conferred on someone.[1,5] These titles can only be earned by an artist by creating a product. “Author ” is someone who goes on an intellectual journey full of twists and turns to create a unique product of his mind; he then shoulders the responsibility to produce a near perfect product. [5]   Potential coauthors who claim a share of this creative effort should ask themselves certain questions: Was I part of a significant stretch of this intellectual journey? Is this effort a near-perfect product of my mind? Can I shoulder some unique responsibilities and defend them? If the answers are yes then he or she should be a coauthor.

**Metadata**

HydroShare resources used to publish data related to this publication will list all authors using the HydroShare metadata fields.  Authors are requested to become HydroShare users and complete the HydroShare profile.  Author order is determined based on the journal, research community practices, and preferences of the co-authors. Author order is controlled by the resource owners, and any user with Edit permissions to the resource. 

**List of authors and responsibilities**

First Author is responsible for the overall coordination and creation of the writing, code and data products. 

Second Author is responsible for contributing scientific ideas designed to reframe the existing case study in Jurutungo into a advancement in geospatial interpolation designed with reproducible open source code.

Author order should be determined by ....[ to do]. 

### Contributors

**Definition**

Contributors provide advice, suggestions, edits and invest time or resources to enhance the publication.  Contributors are not familiar with every aspect of the intellectual contributions in the work, nor are they implied as or held responsible for the standards, rigor, or quality of results presented in the publication.  

**Metadata**

HydroShare resources used to publish data related to the publication will list all contributors using the HydroShare metadata fields.  Contributors are requested to become HydroShare users and complete the HydroShare profile.  Contributors will be listed in the acknowledgement section of the publication. 

**List of contributors and contributions**

### Ownership of a HydroShare resource
Publications and related data may be published on HydroShare as part of the publication process.  This may include generating multiple resources with unique DOIs for contributing datasets or other research products that are outcomes of the work conducted while developing the publication.  Owners of HydroShare resources related to a publication, are responsible for the initiation, maintenance, and serve as the long-term contact that may be necessary to support use of the resource by HydroShare users and the public.  

**Metadata**

Owners must be HydroShare users to create new resources. Owners are requested to become HydroShare users and complete the HydroShare profile. Multiple owners are permitted. 

### Funders
Funding should include all contributing contracts between all institutions supporting researchers and students contributing to the scope of work during and after the completion of the contracted project.  

## 3.0 Code of Conduct 

## Divergent Ways of Interacting

Do you follow the "Two Github Repositories and a Kitten Rule"?
or the 'Two Hurricanes and a Pandemic Rule"?

Community Expectations & Values: Do what you need to do to focus so that you can contribute your work based on your goals. Keep yourself and others compensated fairly. Intellectal property is valuable.  Freely share acknowledgements and contribute to cultures and teams that ensure that value is distributed in ways that have long term impacts for everyone.  

Functional Recommendation: Develop your own personal rules, share them openly with your teams, and continually measure consensus that the rule is working.

### 'Two Hurricanes and Pandemic' by @ChristinaB  [Divergent Ways of Interacting Template]

The RAPID organization has a set of members that that are managed on Github, by principal investigators and leaders of the National Science Foundation project [ RAPID: Collaborative Research: Building Digital Infrastructure and Communities to Assess Risk of Drinking Water Hazards Caused by Hurricanes: Award Abstract #1902600](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1902600&HistoricalAwards=false). New team members must pass the test of these questions: Has this person survived a hurricane or hurricane of data? and given the choice, would you expect to thrive, survive, or by traumatized if you had to work through another hurricane with them? When you imagine scheduling years of unpredictable, chaotic, team projects during online meetings with this person, are you anticipated happy-joy, neutral, or filled with dread?  

Here is the original thought exercise in the book [Works Well With Others (2015)](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317651/works-well-with-others-by-ross-mccammon/) developed based on a resource [Two Beers and a Puppy Rule](https://forge.medium.com/the-2-beers-and-a-puppy-test-is-my-greatest-contribution-to-the-world-17a7feb8cb93) by [Ross McCammon](https://forge.medium.com/@rossmccammon).

## Convergent Ways of Interacting

Our intellectual contributions to teams and collaborators using open science standards can represent a lifetime of work, unpaid labor, personal sacrifice to learn and create shared resources which may in turn represent our greatest contribution to the world. 

The example above is a Living Template example for RAPID research projects and builds on Waterhackweek Learning Resources Code of Conduct, Intelligent Earth Zotero Group, and infinite commitment to time and metadata that supports human well-being, value, and open community.  

### Convergence generalities we try to actually measure:
80:20 Rule:  Spend time thinking and listening and learning, in order to spend 20% of the effort to get 80% of the impact.
90:10 Rule:  Focus 90% of the effort on relationships by planning to mitigate uncertainty and long term impacts. This is critical in work where 10% of the efforts has proven to be impossible or has just not ever been done before (Note: includes most reasons we need massive compute, exponential data, and research software).

## Legal, ethical, and professional standards known to avoid trauma, work disruptions and learning distractions
By signing this agreement, you are committing to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any virtual meeting, in person meeting, conference venue, or public talks. Collaborators violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the collaboration and inclusion in the publication. 

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.

Sexual images in public spaces

Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following

Harassing photography or recording

Sustained disruption of talks or other events

Inappropriate physical contact

Unwelcome sexual attention

Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

Collaborators asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a collaborator engages in harassing behaviour, the lead author and supporting collaborators retain the right to take any actions to keep the collaboration a welcoming environment for all. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from collaboration.

## 4.0 Cultural Disclosure

In an effort to build awareness and sensitivity around cultural issues in the workplace, the following fields may be disclosed to contributors (optional; please assume this is public unless your lead author has confirmed this information will not be shared). 

[ ] - Prefer to not disclose. 

[x] - I have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace.

[x] - I have experienced gender discrimination in the workplace. 

[x] - I self-identify as a minority in my field of work, research or education.

[x] - I have experienced under or lack of credit for my intellectual contributions. 

[x] - I am open to personal conversations on the topics listed above.  

## 5.0 Collaborator Expectations

I expected the following data, code, online or print publications to be included in future work related this publication.

1. Code repo example A

2. HS data publication B

3.  Webpage blog C
